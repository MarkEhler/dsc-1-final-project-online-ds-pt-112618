# King County Housing Data Regresion Prediction vs Neural Network Prediction

The purpose of this repository is to investigate and predict the housing prices in Seattle, Washington using various features given about the property.  This was my first notebook and linear regression model.  The linear regression model struggles from overfitting or outlier houses worth over $1 million.  Recent updates cover a return to this dataset in order to beat my unofficial score of $90,000 MSE using keras neural networks.

## The Dataset

For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging.  The dataset can be found in the file `"kc_house_data.csv"`, in this repo. 

The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository. As with most real world data sets, the coliumn names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgement if you have questions relating to what the data means.

You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible. 

## The Deliverables

There will be three deliverables for this project:

1. **A well documented Jupyter Notebook** containing any code you've written for this project and comments explaining it.  
2. A short **Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation** (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of your methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.
3. **A blog post** (800-1500 words) about one element of the project - it could be the EDA, the feature selection, the choice of visualizations or anything else technical relating to the project. It should be targeted at your peers - aspiring data scientists.
